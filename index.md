Student in the [ANDROIDE master](http://androide.lip6.fr/), I am doing the last year of my master degree in 3 years by taking extra courses in the [BIM master](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/BIM/M2.html#AAGB). In the future, I would like to work in research, more precisely on subjects where I can apply artifical intelligence and graph theory to bio-informatics problems. I am at the moment in an internship at the [Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology (LCQB), Sorbonne Universit√©](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/) working on a learning architecture to predict the disorder of proteins.
