## Hello there, welcome to @DamienLegros profile!

> You can download my [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/DamienLegros/DamienLegros/files/8789733/CV_Damien_Legros_EN.pdf) here! :smile:

Student in the [ANDROIDE master's](http://androide.lip6.fr/), I am doing the last year of my master's degree in 3 years by taking extra courses in the [BIM master's](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/BIM/M2.html#AAGB). In the future, I would like to work in research, more precisely on subjects where I can apply artifical intelligence and graph theory to bio-informatics problems. I am at the moment in an internship at the [Laboratory of Computational and Quantitative Biology (LCQB), Sorbonne Universit√©](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/) working on a learning architecture to predict the disorder of proteins.

### My studies :pencil2:

- Double Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Bioinformatics (ANDROIDE & BIM master's)
- Double Bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics (With a 1 year ERASMUS)

Tofinish!
