# Hello there, welcome to @DamienLegros profile!

> You can download my [CV](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19837427/CV_Damien_Legros.pdf) here! :smile:

I'm working on the protein universe to find novel protein families with new functions as a PhD at VIB.AI in Pereira Lab.

I'm passionate about utilizing my expertise in data science to extract valuable information from complex medical and biological data. I thrive on projects that bridge the gap between data science and the life sciences.

## My Experience :briefcase:

* ### **Doctoral Researcher (From Nov 2025), [VIB.AI Pereira Lab]([https://www.ucb.com/](https://pereiralab.sites.vib.be/en))** - Leuven, Belgium
    - Discovering novel protein families by developing segmentation AI methods on the protein universe.
<br><br>
* **Bioprocess Data Scientist (2 years), [UCB](https://www.ucb.com/)** - Brussels, Belgium
    - Leveraging ML algorithms and pipelines for analysis, modeling and automation in cell culture projects to optimize drug compounds processes

* **Bioinformatics internship (6 months) : [Somatic Evolution](https://www.dkfz.de/en/somatische-evolution-frueherkennung/index.php), DKFZ** - Heidelberg, Germany
    - *“Data analysis of mice tissues on aging using machine learning algorithms”*

* **Master’s thesis (6 months) : [LCQB](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/), Sorbonne Université** - Paris, France
    - *“Learning the disorder of proteins using deep learning approach”*

## Seminars & Schools :microphone:

* **i-Bio Summer School 2022 : [Artificial Intelligence for biologists](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/seminars-summer-schools/)** - Banyuls-sur-Mer, France
    - As a participant

* **Meet-EU 2021 [Symposium](http://ibio.sorbonne-universite.fr/seminars-summer-schools/)** - Online
    - Part of a student group on prediction of compartments

## My Studies :pencil2:

* **Double Master's in [Artificial Intelligence](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/masters/master-informatique/parcours-androide) and [Computational Biology](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/masters/master-informatique/parcours-bim)** - Sorbonne Université in Paris
    - Include 2 master's thesis for each field (6 months internships).

* **Double Bachelor's in [Computer Science and Applied Mathematics](https://math-info.u-paris.fr/parcours-de-licence-bi-diplomant/informatique-mathematiques/)** - Université Paris Cité in Paris
    - ERASMUS mobility year in Trinity College Dublin in Dublin, Ireland
    - Modelling and Simulation

* **Scientific Baccalaureate** - Jules Ferry High School in Paris
    - Mathematics and Biology option

## My Projects :paperclip:

* **Small Data Analysis for Integrative Microbiome and Metabolomics** - [**omicsanalysis**](https://github.com/DamienLegros/omicsanalysis)
  
    - Study on different compartments of diet behavior and human omics layers of data
      
Working on it atm!
