- I am at the moment doing my master's thesis at the [Somatic Evolution group DFKZ, Heidelberg](https://www.dkfz.de/en/somatische-evolution-frueherkennung/index.php). :mag:
- My webpage is available [here](https://damienlegros.github.io/DamienLegros/)! :page_with_curl:
- My profile picture is taken from a painting of [David S. Goodsell](https://ccsb.scripps.edu/goodsell/). Go take a look, they are awesome! :pencil2:
